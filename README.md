# Categories

The "apple_categories.txt" file contains a list of the current Apple podcast categories, which are mostly the industry 
standard.  

The "categories.txt" file contains a deduplicated set of those categories, that could be used as a flat list of labels.

Using labels, a political history podcast could declare its categories as:

* Politics
* Government
* History
* Learning
* Education

Any number of categories could be added as a flat list instead of heirarchical category sets.

It would be fairly trivial to take the compound categories like "Health & Fitness" when discovered in a feed, and
convert those into their single label equivalence.
